Whether you are searching for yourself or searching others for your company, job finding can be tough, especially in the world of engineering. 
Thus, it can take a lot of time and resources to find one. 
This project,attempts to build a learning system that can filter most of the candidates using a set of questions with changeable weights, and only sending the companies the ones that answered the questions with a minimum grade.
To allow to the system to adapt according to the result of the candidates, the system will require the use of nonlinear-programming, and clusterization, in case there are different behaviors in a single company term of acceptance.
The system can save a lot of time and work both for the candidates and both for the companies.
